# Codebook for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
It is assumed that the reviewer is familiar with and has read the README and the features_info.txt 
files contained the archive for this course project. 

If not, the archive may be obtained from this URL: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

## Input Files
The function used the following files in the analysis:
1. features.txt - contains the names of all the variables gathered as described by the 
features_info.txt file
2. activity_labels.txt - contains the names of the six activities used to generate the data
3. train/X_train.txt - contains the training data values for each observation
4. train/subject_train.txt - contains the subject id for each training observation
5. train/y_train.txt - contains the activity id for each training observation
6. test/X_test.txt - contains the test data values for each test observation
7. test/subject_test.txt - contains the subject id for each training observation
8. test/y_test.txt - contains the activity id for each test observation

The files used in the analysis are tied together by their rows. For instance, the first row of X_train.txt file 
was generated by the subject id in the first row of the subject_train.txt file while performing the activity 
indicated by the value in the first row of the y_train.txt file. 

## Output
A data frame written as a text file per the project requirements. That is, a data frame where each row
has the columns of subject id, activity name, and the mean of the values for each variable. 

One thing to note is that the function changes the names of the data variables (not Subjects or Activities).
The rules for these changes are captured in the readme.
